#Getting Notoriety
end of games always start with "Stats for the"... line
next line is always the column headers
list always ends with CHANGE LEVEL:
other lines (connections to server) can occur in the middle of those

could write function that takes the cursor
then removes the first x characters of garbage off the front
then gets the player's name
then gets the stats
and ignores lines about connections
ignores lines where the player's name is linked to a BOT id
and exits when it hits the CHAGE LEVEL line, returning an array
